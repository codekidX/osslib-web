## osslib-web

This project makes it easy to list and maintain parent dependancies for any type of project and consume it at your will and export it as JSON. It is made to have a clear view of my projects and also used for one of my [osslib-android](https://github.com/codekidX/osslib-android) library and will be used in upcoming projects as well.

> **NOTE**
>
> - Currently supports only github repositories because of it's open API nature.
> - All data is stored on your local storage, and does not have any cloud storage system. Any such feature will be added on-demand.

## Working

- **Go to** [osslib-web](https://osslib.ashishshekar.com) website
- **Create** a new project
- **Add** a library path from github _(path is nothing but whatever comes after **https://github.com/**)_
- **Copy to clipboard** for consumption in any of your projects.

## Running project and contributing

This website is made using **create-react-app** basic template.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Look at `package.json` for more scripts and it's working.
